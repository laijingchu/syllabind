# Syllabind (MVP – Frontend Only)

Syllabind is a calm web platform where thought leaders bind the best of the web into **4-week syllabi**. Overwhelmed professionals pick **one** syllabus at a time, work through weekly readings and exercises, and actually finish instead of drowning in listicles and saved links.

This repo currently implements the **client-side UI only**:

- No real authentication
- No real database
- No real analytics

All data can be mocked on the client (e.g. static JSON, in-memory state).

---

## Goals of This Frontend MVP

- Let a user **experience the learner flow**:
  - Dashboard
  - Catalog
  - Syllabus overview
  - Week view (with locked future weeks)
  - Completion screen with badge

- Let a user **experience the creator flow** (using a toggle or fake “creator mode”):
  - Creator dashboard
  - Create/edit syllabus (weeks & steps)
  - Simple “preview as learner”

Backend calls can be represented as:

- Mock fetches
- Local state updates
- Fake “save” actions

---

## Suggested Tech Stack (Frontend)

You can change this, but a simple option:

- **Framework:** React (Vite or CRA) or Next.js (frontend-only mode)
- **Routing:** React Router or Next.js pages
- **State:** Local component state or simple context (no need for Redux, etc.)
- **Styling:** Tailwind, CSS modules, or plain CSS

---

## Core UI Concepts

### Entities (just as types/interfaces on the client)

- `User` (mocked)
  - `id`, `name`
  - `isCreator` (for now you can hard-code or toggle in UI)

- `Syllabus`
  - `id`, `title`, `description`
  - `audienceLevel` (beginner/intermediate/advanced)
  - `durationWeeks` (1–4)
  - `status` (`draft` | `published`)
  - `weeks: Week[]`

- `Week`
  - `index` (1–4)
  - `steps: Step[]`

- `Step`
  - `id`
  - `type` (`reading` | `exercise`)
  - `title`
  - `url?` (for readings)
  - `note?` (short context)
  - `promptText?` (for exercises)
  - `estimatedMinutes?`

- `Enrollment` (client-side only)
  - `activeSyllabusId?`
  - `currentWeekIndex`
  - `completedStepIds: string[]`
  - `badgeEarnedForSyllabusIds: string[]`

You do **not** need to persist this; holding in state is enough for the prototype.

## Screens / Routes

### 1. Learner Dashboard (`/`)

**Purpose:** Show the current syllabus (if any), progress, and completed syllabi.

For this frontend-only version:

- Assume a single “current user” in state.
- Assume 0 or 1 active syllabus at a time.

**UI elements:**

- If active syllabus exists:
  - Card:
    - Title
    - “Week N of X”
    - “Y of Z steps done this week”
    - Button: **Continue**
- Completed section:
  - List of completed syllabi with:
    - Title
    - “Completed on [date]” (fake date)
    - Badge icon
- If no active syllabus:
  - Empty state:
    - Text: “You’re not in a Syllabind right now.”
    - Button: **Browse syllabinds**

### 2. Catalog (`/catalog`)

**Purpose:** Let the learner pick a syllabus.

- Show a grid/list of mock syllabi.
- Each card:
  - Title
  - Short description
  - Duration (1–4 weeks)
  - Audience level
  - Button: **View syllabus**

### 3. Syllabus Overview (`/syllabus/:id`)

**Purpose:** Explain what this Syllabind is, without overloading details.

- Show:
  - Title
  - Description
  - Duration (e.g. “4 weeks”)
  - Audience level
  - High-level week summary (e.g. “Week 1: Foundations”, “Week 2: Tools”).
- Do **not** show all steps for all weeks.
- Button:
  - If no active syllabus: **Start this Syllabind**
  - If another syllabus is active:
    - Show confirmation modal (client-only):
      - “You can only take one Syllabind at a time. Switch to this one?”
      - Buttons: **Switch** / **Cancel**

For now, switching just changes `activeSyllabusId` in client state and resets progress for the new one.

### 4. Week View (`/syllabus/:id/week/:index`)

**Purpose:** Show this week’s reading + exercises and track progress.

**UI:**

- Heading:
  - `Syllabus title`
  - `Week N of X`
- List steps for this week only:
  - For each `reading`:
    - Title
    - Optional note
    - Link (can just open `url` in new tab)
    - Checkbox or button: **Mark as done**
  - For each `exercise`:
    - Prompt text
    - Textarea for answer
    - Button: **Save** (then mark as done)

- At top or bottom:
  - “You’ve completed Y of Z steps this week.”
  - Progress bar.

**Locking UI:**

- If user tries to navigate directly to `/week/3` when they haven’t finished week 2:
  - Show a simple message:
    - “You’ll unlock Week 3 after finishing all steps in Week 2.”
  - Provide button: “Go to current week”.

Implementation: in client state, decide `currentWeekIndex` based on `completedStepIds` and block navigation.

### 5. Completion Screen (`/syllabus/:id/completed`)

**Purpose:** Give a clear “you’re done” moment and show badge.

**UI:**

- Headline: “You’ve completed this Syllabind.”
- Subtext: “You finished all readings and exercises.”
- Show full progress (100%).
- Badge:
  - Icon + text: “Completion badge earned”.
- Optional textarea for a final reflection (client-side only).
- Buttons:
  - “Review your notes & submissions” (could route to a simple summary page).
  - “Browse other Syllabinds”.

### 6. Creator Zone (frontend only)

For now, you can expose Creator Mode with a simple **toggle / button** in the UI (no real codes):

- Example:
  - In a “Settings” page, a button: **Enable creator mode (demo)**.
  - When clicked, sets `isCreator = true` in client state.

#### 6.1 Creator Dashboard (`/creator`)

- Show list of **creator’s syllabi** (mocked, or filter by a `creatorId`).
- Each row/card:
  - Title
  - Status: Draft / Published
  - Duration (weeks)
  - Fake metrics (e.g. “42 learners started, 13 completed” hard-coded)
  - Buttons: **Edit**, **Preview**

#### 6.2 Create/Edit Syllabus (`/creator/syllabus/new` and `/creator/syllabus/:id/edit`)

Single page with two main sections:

1. **Basics**
   - Title input
   - Description textarea
   - Audience level dropdown
   - Duration selector (1–4 weeks)

2. **Weeks & Steps**
   - Tabs or accordion for each week.
   - Within each week:
     - “Add reading” button:
       - Opens inline form with:
         - Title
         - URL
         - Optional note
         - Estimated minutes
     - “Add exercise” button:
       - Prompt text
       - Estimated minutes
     - Ability to reorder steps via drag & drop (or simple up/down arrows).

At the bottom:

- Buttons:
  - “Save as draft” (updates local state)
  - “Publish” (sets status to Published in local state)

#### 6.3 Preview as Learner

- From Creator Dashboard, clicking “Preview as learner”:
  - Routes to the Syllabus Overview and Week view, but:
    - Uses a separate “demo learner state” or just ignores actual enrollment rules.
    - Goal is just to see what it would look like.

Backend integration for real creators can be added later.
