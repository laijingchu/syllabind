### 1. Goal of Creator Analytics (V1)

Give creators **just enough data** to answer:

1. Are people actually starting my Syllabind?  
2. Are they finishing?  
3. Where do they fall off?  

No heavy dashboards, no cohorts, just a few honest numbers.

---

### 2. Where analytics lives

**Page:** `CreatorAnalyticsPage` or a tab on the Syllabus editor

- Route: `/creator/syllabus/:id/analytics`
- Entry points:
    - From Creator Dashboard row: button **“Analytics”**
    - From Syllabus Editor: top-right tab **“Analytics”**

---

### 3. Metrics to show (per Syllabind)

#### 3.1 High-level counters

At the top:

1. **Learners started**  
    - Definition: number of unique learners who have ever started this Syllabind.
    - Label: `Learners started: 127`
2. **Learners completed**  
    - Definition: unique learners with this Syllabind marked `completed`.
    - Label: `Learners completed: 43`
3. **Completion rate**  
    - `completionRate = learnersCompleted / learnersStarted`
    - Label: `Completion rate: 34%`
4. **Average progress** (optional but nice)  
    - Average % of steps completed across all learners who started.
    - Label: `Average progress: 62% of steps`

Frontend-only version: you can **fake these numbers** from a mock dataset.

---

#### 3.2 Week‑by‑week drop-off

Show a simple bar/step chart:

- Title: **How far learners get**
- For each week `1..durationWeeks`, show % of learners who reached that week at least once.

Example display:

- Week 1 – `100%` (everyone starts here)
- Week 2 – `62%`
- Week 3 – `47%`
- Week 4 – `34%`

Under the chart:

- Text:
    
    `Most learners stop between Week 1 and Week 2.` (just pick the steepest drop).
    

Frontend: compute this from mock `enrollments` + `stepProgress` or hard-code for now.

---

#### 3.3 “Most common dropout spot”

We keep it very simple:

- Title: **Most common dropout step**
- Show:
    - Week number
    - Step title

Example:

> **Most common dropout step:**
> 

> Week 2 – “Read: Long industry report on AI adoption”
> 

This can be calculated as:

- For each step, count “learners who reached this step but did not complete it and didn’t complete the syllabus”.
- Pick the step with the highest count.

For frontend only, you can mock: pick a step in Week 2 and label it as the top dropout.

---

### 4. Page layout (wireframe in words)

**Top:**

- Syllabus title
- Status tag: Draft / Published

**Section 1: Key stats (cards)**

- Card 1: Learners started
- Card 2: Learners completed
- Card 3: Completion rate
- Card 4 (optional): Average progress

**Section 2: Progress through weeks**

- Heading: “How far learners get”
- Bar chart or horizontal bars per week with %.
- Caption line describing main drop-off.

**Section 3: Dropout insight**

- Heading: “Most common dropout spot”
- Highlighted week + step title.
- Small helper text:
    - `Consider shortening, replacing, or moving this step if it’s too heavy for most learners.`

Later, you can add:

- A basic list: “Other friction points” (2–3 next worst steps).

---

### 5. Interactions

- If there is **no data yet** (0 learners started):
    - Replace numbers with:
        - `–` or `0`
        - Empty state text: *“No learners have started this Syllabind yet. Once people begin, you’ll see starts, completions, and drop-off here.”*
- Filters (optional, can skip for V1):
    - Time range (Last 30 days / All-time).
    - For now, default to **All-time** only.

---

### 6. Frontend-only implementation notes

Since you’re only building client side now:

- Represent “analytics data” as a **mock object**:

```tsx
type SyllabusAnalytics = {
  syllabusId: string;
  learnersStarted: number;
  learnersCompleted: number;
  completionRate: number; // 0–1
  averageProgress: number; // 0–1
  weekReachPercentages: number[]; // [1.0, 0.62, 0.47, 0.34]
  topDropoutStep: {
    weekIndex: number;
    stepId: string;
    stepTitle: string;
  } | null;
};
```

- In `CreatorAnalyticsPage`, you:
    - Look up `SyllabusAnalytics` for the current syllabus id.
    - Render the cards / chart / dropout block.

When you later wire up a backend, you can use this exact shape for a `/api/creator/syllabus/:id/analytics` response.
