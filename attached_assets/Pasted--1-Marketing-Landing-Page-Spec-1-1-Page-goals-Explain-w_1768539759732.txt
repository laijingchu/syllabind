## 1. Marketing Landing Page – Spec

### 1.1 Page goals

- Explain what Syllabind is and why it exists (for overwhelmed professionals + thought leaders).

- Funnel visitors to:
    - **Primary:** Sign up / Get early access.
    - **Secondary:** View a sample syllabus.

### 1.2 Sections (top to bottom)

#### A. Hero

**Content**

- Headline:
    
    `Syllabind – one calm syllabus through the chaos`
    
- Subhead (short):
    
    `Turn expert listicles into four-week learning journeys you can actually finish.`
    
- Bullet support (optional, 2–3 bullets):
    - `Choose one syllabus at a time.`
    - `Follow weekly readings and exercises.`
    - `Finish and earn a completion badge.`

#### B. “Why” Section

**Heading:**  

`The internet made learning infinite. It also made it unbearable.`

**Body (short paragraph)**

Explain pain:

- Feeds full of “ultimate guides” and threads.
- People saving hundreds of links, finishing almost none.
- Constant feeling of being behind on AI/strategy/etc.

**Optional mini-list of pains**

- `Too many listicles, no clear path.`
- `Decision fatigue every time you “sit down to learn”.`
- `Passive reading that never turns into real skills.`

---

#### C. “What is Syllabind?” Section

**Heading:**  

`What Syllabind does`

**Body**

One short paragraph:

> Syllabind lets thought leaders bind their best articles, videos, and threads into calm, four-week syllabi. Learners pick one syllabus, follow weekly readings and prompts, and finish with notes, projects, and a clear completion moment.
> 

**3 feature cards (for learners)**

- **One syllabus at a time**
    
    *No juggling five courses. Commit to one path this month.*
    
- **Four weeks, clear weekly plans**
    
    *Each Syllabind is 1–4 weeks with a finite set of readings and exercises.*
    
- **Active, not passive**
    
    *Prompts and small assignments nudge you to use what you’ve learned, not just skim.*
    

---

#### D. Calm Learning Principles (shortened)

**Heading:**  

`Calm learning, by design`

Present as 3–4 concise bullets:

- **One course at a time** – You always know what you’re working on.
- **4 weeks or less** – A finishable commitment, not a new degree.
- **Focus on this week only** – You see this week’s steps; future weeks unlock as you go.
- **A real completion moment** – Finish all steps and submissions to earn your Syllabind badge.

---

#### E. For Learners / For Creators (split section)

Two columns or stacked blocks.

**For learners**

- Heading: `For overwhelmed professionals in the AI era`
- 2–3 bullets:
    - `Choose one structured syllabus instead of bookmarking 20 threads.`
    - `See exactly what to do this week, not the whole mountain.`
    - `Keep all your notes and submissions in one place.`

**For thought leaders**

- Heading: `For thought leaders who want to go beyond threads`
- 2–3 bullets:
    - `Dock your existing posts, videos, and resources into a linear syllabus.`
    - `Add context and prompts so learners take action, not just like your post.`
    - `See simple analytics: starts, completions, and drop-off.`

---

#### F. Sample Syllabus (optional but powerful)

**Heading:**  

`See a sample Syllabind`

- Show a single example:
    - Title: *“AI for Product Managers in 2026”*
    - Subtitle: *4 weeks · Intermediate · ~3–4 hours/week*
    - Simple week list:
        - Week 1: Foundations
        - Week 2: Tools & workflows
        - Week 3: Product decisions
        - Week 4: Shipping something real

#### G. Early Access / Sign-up Call-to-Action

**Heading:**  

`Join the early access list`

**Body:**

> We’re starting Syllabind with a small group of learners and thought leaders who care about deep, structured learning in the AI era.
> 

**Form (frontend spec)**

Fields:

- `Email` (required)
- `I’m primarily a…` (radio or select)
    - `Learner`
    - `Thought leader / creator`
    - `Both`
- `What do you want to learn or teach?` (optional textarea, 1–2 lines)

Buttons:

- **Get early access**

Success state (client-side):

- Replace form with:
    - `Thanks for signing up. We’ll be in touch when the first Syllabinds are ready.`

For now, form submission can:

- POST to a simple mock endpoint or
- Just log to console / store in a local list (until backend exists).

---

## 2. Sign-up Flow – Spec (Frontend Only)

For now, you can keep **account creation extremely lightweight** and focus on the UX.

### 2.1 Entry points

- Hero **“Get early access”** button.
- Top-right **“Sign up”** link in nav.
- Optional **“See sample without signing up”** link for low-friction demo.

### 2.2 Sign-up Modal / Page

**Option:** Modal overlay or dedicated page at `/signup`.

**Fields:**

- `Name` (required, simple text)
- `Email` (required)
- `Password` (required – even if backend is fake, UX is realistic)
- `I’m primarily a…` (radio)
    - Learner
    - Thought leader / creator
    - Both

**Buttons:**

- Primary: **Create account**
- Secondary text link: “Already have an account? Log in.”

**Validation (client-only):**

- Non-empty name / email / password.
- Email basic format check.
- Show inline error messages under fields.

**After “Create account” (frontend only):**

- Pretend sign-up succeeded.
- Store user object in memory (and optionally `localStorage`), e.g.:
    - `{ id: 'mock-1', name, email, isCreator: false, rolePreference }`
- Redirect to **Learner Dashboard** (`/`) as logged-in user.

### 2.3 Login (simple)

For completeness and realistic feel.

- Route `/login` or modal.
- Fields:
    - Email
    - Password
- On submit:
    - For now, just match against a simple in-memory map or always “succeed” and restore a mock user.
    - Redirect to dashboard.

---

### 2.4 Creator Mode “unlock” (UI-only)

You can hint at your future creator-code flow without implementing real admin:

- In **Profile / Settings**:
    - Section: `Become a creator`
        - Description:
            
            `Creator Mode unlocks the tools to build Syllabinds from your own content. In this prototype, you can toggle it on to explore the creator experience.`
            
        - Button: **Enable creator mode (demo)**
- On click:
    - Set `isCreator = true` in frontend state.
    - Show Creator Zone in nav.

Later, when backend exists, this area becomes:

- “Enter creator code” input + verify.

---

### 2.5 Post sign-up first-run experience

After successful sign-up, the first dashboard view should:

- Welcome message:
    
    `Welcome to Syllabind. You don’t have an active syllabus yet.`
    
- Two CTAs:
    - **Browse syllabinds** (primary) → `/catalog`
    - **See a sample syllabus** (secondary) → sample route

If they indicated “Thought leader / creator” during sign-up, optionally show:

- Small note:
    
    `Interested in building your own Syllabind? Creator tools are coming soon. In this prototype, you can try a demo creator mode from Settings.`
